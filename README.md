# Smart Predict-then-Optimize for Portfolio Optimization

## Introduction  
This project implements an end-to-end portfolio optimization framework based on the Smart Predict-then-Optimize(SPO) methodology.  
(For more details: [Smart Predict-then-Optimize](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08005))

We aims to improve portfolio allocation by jointly optimizing prediction accuracy and investment decisions by integrating deep learning time series forecasting models with SPO+ loss functions.

## Key Features  
- Forecast future asset returns using deep learning models such as LSTM and DLinear  
- Train models with SPO+ loss to align prediction with optimization goals  
- Backtesting module to evaluate portfolio performance  
- Visualization of training losses and backtesting results
